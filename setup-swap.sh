# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script will create swap file if the swap file does not exist.
# It will disable the swap file and re-create it if it does exist.
#
# Re-create the swap to adjust the size when you change AWS instance types.
#
# Based on advice from:
# https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/
#
# USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK AND STUDY THE CODE CAREFULLY.
#
# For usage, login as root, run "./setupSwap.sh"
#
# Note the following assumptions:
# - you have enough disk-space for the new swap
#   - less than 2 Gb RAM - swap size: 2x the amount of RAM
#   - more than 2 GB RAM, but less than 32 GB - swap size: 4 GB + (RAM â€“ 2 GB)
#   - 32 GB of RAM or more - swap size: 1x the amount of RAM
# - you are running as root user
# - your swap file is called: swapfile
